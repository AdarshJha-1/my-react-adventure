## Welcome to my React experience log! Here, I'll share my learning journey step by step as I dive into the world of React. Let's explore the highs, lows, and everything in between together!

## Day-1
- Today was my first day of learning React. I began by creating a React app using create-react-app, which installed a bunch of folders, dependencies, and some pre-written code. The initialization process took some time, but it set up the React app folder.

- I then tried Vite to run my React web app. Compared to create-react-app, Vite was lightweight, faster, and came with only the required dependencies. I explored the folders generated by Vite and create-react-app, learning about the package.json file. After understanding the structure, I deleted all the pre-written code and printed a simple "Hello World" with my name, "Adarsh Jha," using both Vite and create-react-app.

- It was an amazing experience! I've just started learning React, and I'm loving it. I hope this feeling remains the same throughout my learning journey.
